          Rithm is a unique dating concept centered around the idea that your musical taste and online vibe, as reflected by your Instagram explore page, can be a powerful indicator of compatibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of endless swiping based on just a few photos, Rithm asks users to share a glimpse into their digital world via a screenshot of their explore page. This provides a richer, more nuanced first impression.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you swipe right on someone whose vibe resonates with yours, and they swipe right on you too, it's a match! Only then are Instagram handles revealed, opening the door for connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          No lengthy profiles, no complex algorithms â€“ just pure vibes.
